Version 0.6 :
- support the a (arc) command in the SVGPath format
- fix the RadialGradient conversion
- fix cases where the size of a Background image was 0, now don't use these Backgrounds anymore in the conversion
- allow to use listeners in the conversion process, which can interfere in the conversion at the beginning or end of a Node
- fix the positioning of scaled paths in Regions
- fix a case of possible NPE in the filling of Shapes in the PPT converter
- fix the horizontal or vertical lines not being absolutely horizontal or vertical in the PPT converter
- fix the rendering of proportional Radial gradients
- fix another possible exception in the converting
- support part of the border specification, both directly in Regions and as CSS properties
- support proportional width and height for Region backgrounds
- support disabled states for Nodes
- fix rotations angles which were incorrectly not converted from degrees to radians (from JavaFX to Awt)
- support the -fx-opacity CSS property
- Add a class to manage the conversion configuration, for the moment allowing to control the showing of the disabled 
 states for Nodes. It is possible to set directly the parameters of this class, or by parsing an XML configuration File
- Start some examples of an SVG conversion implementation

Version 0.7 :
 - use MDIUtilities 0.8.6
 - add a complete and simple PPT example in the tools directory
 - fix cases where a Node with opacity 0 had an opacity put to 1 if its CSS property sets its opacity to 1

Version 0.8 :
 - fix cases where the library could try to set a negative opacity to a Node

Version 0.9 :
- fix gradients which were not handled in the SVG driver output
- fallback to Batik 1.7 rather than 1.8 because 1.8 is still a bit unstable

Version 0.10 :
- fix background radii which were too big after conversion
- support translations and scales in the CSS properties

- fix the size of the ImageViews in some cases, especially when using fitting on width or height
- fix some cases where the Regions backgrounds had a wrong size after the conversion
- fix cases where the border of a Region had a 0 width and was still painted

Version 0.11 :
- fix completely (or so I think) -fx-shape used for Regions 
- fix the positioning of Region textures in some cases
- fix the startAngle for SVGPaths arcs which was incorrect

Version 0.12 :
- remove a unused System.out (which could trigger a NPE in some cases)
- use the MDIUtilities library 0.8.7

Version 0.13 :
- Use MDIUtilities 0.8.8
- support the -fx-arc-width and -fx-arc-height properties for Rectangles
- fix some cases where clipping a Polygon in PowerPoint would lead to an incorrect resulting Shape
- fix the immediate children of the top-most container visible in the conversion even if they are not visible
- fix the angles of rotation not being correctly converted from degrees to radians
- changed the name of the GroupGraphics2D interface to ExtendedGraphics2D and add a method in the interface which allows to
  process Effects on Nodes in the conversion process

Version 0.14 :
- Partial fix to the problem of rotated Images in PPT
- Support Shadows in PPT conversion

Version 0.15 :

Version 0.16 :
- Fix the angles of the rotation transforms which were wrong (minus the right value) in some cases

Version 0.17 :
 - Fix some cases where the PPT driver could throw a NPE for small clipped Images
 - Add the support for converting SubScenes and Shape3D Nodes

Version 0.18 :
 - Support GradientPaint for the PPT converter (the color will be the brightest of the two colors)
 - Fix the clipping of some horizontal or vertical lines in the PPT converter which was incorrect

Version 0.19 :
